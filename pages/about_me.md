## Nice meeting you

I'm always fascinated by new challenges, especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies.

I find myself at the intersection between __creativity__ and __logic__, solving problems
with a fresh and multidisciplinary approach.

My world became made of code long before I started shaving. In the last __13 years__ _of my freelance career_, I have developed in a multitude of programming languages starting from C to python, ruby and javascript.

I'm more than just a full-stack developer, I'm a graphic designer and
I love to create user interfaces.

My hobbies include video editing, music composing and photography.

I'm a full-time freelancer, always looking for new challenges and inspiring projects.

## Skills

 - Project Management and planning.
 - Client-side and server-side development.
 - UI/UX Blueprinting and Design.
 - Linux server setup and administration.
 - Graphic/Logo Design.
 - Version control, automated testing/build/deployment.
 - Video editing and animation.
 - Music composing.

I'm currently developing in __Javascript__, __React__, __React Native__ and __NodeJS__
creating APIs, Backends, Front-ends, and mobile applications.
I love __HTML5__, and __CSS3__/__Less__ which I use to make very cool and responsive UI.  

__MongoDB__, __Redis__, __GraphQL__ and a bunch of __Relational Databases__ are always in my mind and at the tip of my fingertips.

I have also a good knowledge of __PHP__, __Angular.js__, __Python__, and I have no problem dealing with other languages such as  __Java__, __C/C++/C#__, __LUA__, etc.

I think of a programming language is just a tool in one's toolbox.
You just have to pick the right tool for the job.

Always experimenting, always learning, never bored.
