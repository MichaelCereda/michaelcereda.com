-------
My personal website (the website you're using now!) has been built in __React__, __HTML__, __CSS__.

Instead of creating a simple Wordpress website i decided to develop an Isomorphic/Universal React based website.


 Café Barbera is a mobile application created to improve the brand awareness and
encourage consumer to be more loyal, with rewards, special offers and so on.

It's currently used in production by all the shops of the Café Barbera franchise.

I built the whole infrastructure starting from scratch using mainly __Javascript__
and a little bit of Native Code.

## User Interface
I started the creation of the UI with the idea that the app should immediate and
hassle free, serving the user while in the shop and providing useful information
and push notifications while outside.

## Server-side
One of the main challenges in building an app used worldwide is scalability
and handling usage peaks without causing any interruption.  

Café Barbera has 600 shops worldwide with an average of 500-1000 customers per day.  
Seems obvious that a cloud implementation is more than necessary.  

I implemented the API using __NodeJS__, __MongoDB__ and __Redis__ and deployed it
on __Amazon AWS__.
