Source code of my website (michaelcereda.com)

It has been built in __React__, __HTML__, __CSS__.

Instead of creating a simple Wordpress website i decided to develop an Isomorphic/Universal React based website.  

I wrote some posts on my blog about the making of this website, if you're curious about it [check here](https://medium.com/@michaelcereda/creating-an-isomorphic-universal-website-with-react-part-1-a905350acba8#.rc2xxzjg5)
